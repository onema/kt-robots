# KT-Robots

In KT-Robots, you program a battle robot that participates on a square game field. Each turn, the server invokes your robot's Lambda function to get its action for the turn until either the robot wins or is destroyed.

**KT-Robots is a port of the [Î»-Robots](https://github.com/LambdaSharp/LambdaRobots) and the 90s [P-Robots](https://corewar.co.uk/probots.htm) game to [kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and [spring](https://spring.io/).**

 
## Level 0: Setup

### Install the required tools
Make sure the following tools are installed in your computer
<details>
<summary>Setup Instructions</summary>

- [Download and install the JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- [Download and isntall the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
- [Download and install Terraform 12](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
</details>

### Setup AWS Account and CLI
The challenge requires an AWS account. AWS provides a [*Free Tier*](https://aws.amazon.com/free/), which is sufficient for the challenge.
<details>
<summary>Setup Instructions</summary>

- [Create an AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com)
- [Configure your AWS profile with the AWS CLI for us-east-2 (Ohio)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html#cli-quick-configuration)
</details>

> **NOTE:** 
> 
> For this challenge we will be using the US-EAST-2 region

### Clone Git Challenge Repository
<details>
<summary>Clone command</summary>

Run the following command to clone the KT-Robots challenge. 
```bash
git@github.com:onema/kt-robots.git
cd kt-robots
```
</details>

## Level 1: Deploy functions and server
### Deploy using the Terraform
From the command line use `gradlew` to run the `deployRobots` task: 
```bash
./gradlew deployRobots
```

This task will compile the `lambda-robots` project, and deploy the lambda functions to your AWS account in the `us-east-2` (Ohio) region. 

<details>
<summary>Use the InjelliJ Gradle Plugin</summary>

Or use the IntelliJ gradle plugin to execute the task.

![deployRobots](images/deployRobots.png)
</details>



Once the command has finished running, the output will show you the ARN of the lambda robots.
```
Outputs:

HotShotRobotArn = arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:123456789012:function:HotShot
RoboDogRobotArn = arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:123456789012:function:RoboDog
YosemiteSamRobotArn = arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:1234567890120:function:YosemiteSam
YourRobotARN = arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:123456789012:function:BringYourOwnRobot
```

The `BringYourOwnRobot` is the robot you will be working on!

> **NOTE:** 
> 
> Open `lambda-robots/src/main/kotlin/io.onema.ktrobots.lambda/functions/BringYourOwnRobot` and customize the `NAME` of your robot to distinguish it from other robots.

### Deploy the game server using Terraform 
From the command line use `gradlew` to run the `deployServer` task:
```bash
./gradlew deployServer
```
This task will compile the `server` project, and deploy it to AWS Fargate in the `us-east-2` (Ohio) region.

<details>
<summary>Deployment details</summary>

This command will create and do a few things:

1. Copile the server
2. Creates a docker image that runs the server
4. Create an ECR docker repository to host the image
5. Pushes the image to the new docker repository
6. Creates a Fargate cluster
7. Creates a service and runs a task exposing port 8080

</details>

<details>
<summary>Getting the task IP Address</summary>
Once the deployment has finished, you will have to login to AWS to get the server IP:
- Amazon ECS
- Clusters
- ktrobots-server-cluster
- Tasks
- Select the task from the list
- Copy the Public IP
- You can also expand the task details and get a link to the cloudwatch logs

Once you have the IP paste it in your broser usin the port `8080`
```
# For example
http://3.15.171.35:8080/
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Adding robots to game board</summary>

You can add the robot lambda function ARN to the game board client in the browser.  **You can add the ARN multiple times.**

![Game configuration](images/gameConfiguration.png)

Use the **Advance Configuration** to change any default settings.  Use **Clear Saved Config** to reset all settings to default.
</details>

## Level 2: Create an Attack Strategy

Now that you have deployed all the robots to your account, add the ARN of the `TargetRobot` multiple times to the KT-Robots server to create targets.


Now update the behavior of `BringYourOwnRobot` to shoot down the target robots. 

### Use Luck - YosemiteSam 
For example, you can use luck, like `YosemiteSam`, which shoots in random directions

<details>
<summary>YosemiteSam Details</summary>

![Yosemite Sam](images/yosemiteSam.png)

Yosemite Sam is fast and trigger happy!

This robot chooses a random angle on every turn and fires a missile. It has an extra large engine which helps it avoid attacks and keeps it's distance from the edges of the game board to avoid collisions!

| Equipment | Type              | Points | Details |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------ | ------- |
| Armor     | Light             | 1      |         |
| Engine    | Extra Large       | 4      |         |
| Radar     | Ultra Short Range | 0      |         |
| Missile   | Dart              | 0      |         |
| Total     |                   | 5      |         |
</details>


### Use Targeting - HotShot 

This robot uses the `scan()` method to find enemies and aim missiles at them. 
<details>
<summary>HotShot Details</summary>

![HotShot](images/hotShot.jpg)

HotShot is patient and accurate, it hardly ever misses it's target!

This robot uses the `scan()` method to find targets, if it doesn't find targets it moves to a new location. If it receives damage it initiates an evasive move. 

| Equipment | Type        | Points | Details |
| --------- | ----------- | ------ | ------- |
| Armor     | Medium      | 2      |         |
| Engine    | Large       | 3      |         |
| Radar     | Short Range | 1      |         |
| Missile   | Javelin     | 2      |         |
| Total     |             | 8      |         |
</details>

### Chase like a dog - RoboDog 

This robot uses the `scan()` method to find enemies and chases them. 
<details>
<summary>RoboDog Details</summary>

![RoboDog](images/roboDog.jpg)

RoboDog moves at random and scans what is right in front of it, when this dog bites it won't let go!

This robot uses the `scan()` method to find targets right in from of it, if it does it adjust it's heading to move towards the target, this dog can hit you with a missile and with collision damage!

| Equipment | Type              | Points | Details |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------ | ------- |
| Armor     | Light             | 2      |         |
| Engine    | Standard          | 3      |         |
| Radar     | Ultra Short Range | 0      |         |
| Missile   | Cannon            | 3      |         |
| Total     |                   | 8      |         |
</details>

### TargetRobot 

This robot just sits down and waits to be hit. 
<details>
<summary>TargetRobot Details</summary>

![TargetRobot](images/targetRobot.png)

Please don't be the target robot, no body wants to be the target robot!

| Equipment | Type              | Points | Details |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------ | ------- |
| Armor     | Heavy             | 3      |         |
| Engine    | Economy           | 0      |         |
| Radar     | Ultra Short Range | 0      |         |
| Missile   | Dart              | 0      |         |
| Total     |                   | 3      |         |
</details>


### Remember that 
- Other robots may be out of radar range, requiring your robot to move periodically. 
- Your robot can be damaged by its own missiles. 
- Check `gameInfo.farHitRange` to make sure your target is beyond the damage range. 
- If you don't mind a bit of self-inflicted pain, you can also use `gameInfo.nearHitRange` or even `game.directHitRange` instead.

## Level 3: Create an Evasion Strategy

Add the `YosemiteSam` ARN twice to the KT-Robots server to create two attackers.

Now update the behavior of `BringYourOwnRobot` to avoid getting shot. 

<details>
<summary>Examples</summary>

You can continuous motion, like `YosemiteSam`, which zig-zags across the board.

Reacting to damage like `HotShotRobot`. 

Beware that a robot cannot change heading without suddenly stopping if its speed exceeds `Robot.MaxSpeed`.
</details>

## Level 4: Take on the Champ

Add the `HotShot` ARN once to the KT-Robots server to create one formidable opponent.

Consider modifying your robot build by tuning the 
- engine
- armor 
- missile
- radar 
Set the proper equipment to suit your attack and evasion strategies. 

**Remember that your build cannot exceed 8 points, or your robot will be disqualified from the competition.**

## BOSS LEVEL: Enter the Multi-Team Deathmatch Competition

For the boss level, your opponent is every other team! Submit your Robot ARN to final showdown and see how well it fares.

**May the odds be ever in your favor!**

## Programming Reference

<summary>Reference Details</summary>

### Pre-Build Lambda-Robots

The `lambda-robots/src/main/kotlin/io.onema.ktrobots.lambda/functions/` folder contains additional robots that are deployed, these have different behaviors.
Next, we need a few robots to battle it out. 
* `TargetRobot`: This is a stationary robot for other robots to practice on.
* `YosemiteSam`: This robot runs around shooting in random directions as fast as it can.
* `HotShot`: This robot uses its radar to find other robots and fire at them. When hit, this robot moves around the board.
* `RoboDog`: This robot moves around shooting straight in front of it, when it finds a target it changes direction and chasses it, this robot will do collision damage.

### LambdaRobots SDK

Derive your Lambda-Robot from the `LambdaRobotFunction` provided by the SDK.

#### Abstract Methods
The base class requires two methods to be implemented:
