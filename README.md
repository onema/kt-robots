# KT-Robots

In KT-Robots, you program a battle robot that participates in a square game field. Each turn, the server invokes your robot's Lambda function to get its action until the robot wins or is destroyed.

**KT-Robots is a port of the [Î»-Robots](https://github.com/LambdaSharp/LambdaRobots) and the 90s [P-Robots](https://corewar.co.uk/probots.htm) game to [kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and [spring](https://spring.io/).**

### Clone Git Challenge Repository
<details>
<summary>Clone command</summary>

Run the following command to clone the KT-Robots challenge. 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:onema/kt-robots.git
cd kt-robots
```
</details>
</details>

## Level 1: Deploy functions and server
<details>
<summary>Deploy lambda functions and server</summary>
 
### Deploy using Terraform
From the command line use `gradlew` to run the `deployRobots` task: 
```bash
./gradlew deployRobots
```
<details>
<summary>Details</summary>

This task will 
- Compile the `lambda-robots` project
- Deploy the Lambda functions to your AWS account in the `us-east-2` (Ohio) region using Terraform
- The terraform code is in the `lambda-robots/infrastructure` directory
</details>

<details>
<summary>Use the InjelliJ Gradle Plugin</summary>

Or use the IntelliJ Gradle plugin to execute the task.

</details>



Once the command has finished running, the output shows you the ARN of the lambda robots.
```bash
Outputs:

HotShotRobotArn = arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:123456789012:function:HotShot
RoboDogRobotArn = arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:123456789012:function:RoboDog
YosemiteSamRobotArn = arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:1234567890120:function:YosemiteSam
YourRobotARN = arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:123456789012:function:BringYourOwnRobot
```

The `YourRobotARN` is the robot you will be working on!

> **NOTE:** 
> 
> Open `lambda-robots/src/main/kotlin/io.onema.ktrobots.lambda/functions/BringYourOwnRobot` and customize the `NAME` of your robot to distinguish it from other robots.

### Deploy the game server using Terraform 
From the command line use `gradlew` to run the `deployServer` task:
```bash
./gradlew deployServer
```
<details>
<summary>Details</summary>

This task creates and does a few things:

- Compile the server
- Deploy the game server to your AWS account in the `us-east-2` (Ohio) region using Terraform
- Creates a docker image that runs the server
- Create an ECR docker repository to host the image
- Pushes the image to the new docker repository
- Creates a Fargate cluster
- Creates a service and runs a task exposing port 80
- The terraform code is in the `server/infrastructure` directory


</details>

<details>
<summary>Getting the task IP Address</summary>
Once the deployment has finished, you have to log in to AWS to get the server IP:
- Amazon ECS
- Clusters
- ktrobots-server-cluster
- Tasks
- Select the task from the list
- Copy the Public IP
- You can also expand the task details and get a link to the CloudWatch logs

Once you have the IP paste it in your browser.
```bash
# For example
http://3.1.11.111/
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Adding robots to game board</summary>

You can add the robot lambda function ARN to the game board client in the browser.  **You can add the ARN multiple times.**

![Game configuration](images/gameConfiguration.png)

Use the **Advance Configuration** to change any default settings.  Use **Clear Saved Config** to reset all settings to default.
</details>
</details>

## Level 2: Create an Attack Strategy

<details>
<summary>Develop your attack strategy</summary>

Now that you have deployed all the robots to your account add the ARN of the `TargetRobot` multiple times to the KT-Robots server to create targets.


Now update the behavior of `BringYourOwnRobot` to shoot down the target robots. 

### Use Luck - YosemiteSam 
For example, you can use luck, like `YosemiteSam`, which shoots in random directions.

![Yosemite Sam](images/yosemiteSam.png)

<details>
<summary>YosemiteSam Details</summary>

Yosemite Sam is fast and trigger happy!

This robot chooses a random angle on every turn and fires a missile. It has an extra-large engine that helps avoid attacks and keeps its distance from the edges of the game board to avoid collisions!

| Equipment | Type              | Points | Details |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------ | ------- |
| Armor     | Light             | 1      |         |
| Engine    | Extra Large       | 4      |         |
| Radar     | Ultra Short Range | 0      |         |
| Missile   | Dart              | 0      |         |
| Total     |                   | 5      |         |
</details>


### Use Targeting - HotShot 
This robot uses the `scan()` method to find enemies and aim missiles at them. 
![HotShot](images/hotShot.jpg)

<details>
<summary>HotShot Details</summary>

HotShot is patient and accurate; it hardly ever misses its target!

This robot uses the `scan()` method to find targets. If it doesn't find targets, it moves to a new location. If it receives damage, it initiates an evasive move. 

| Equipment | Type        | Points | Details |
| --------- | ----------- | ------ | ------- |
| Armor     | Medium      | 2      |         |
| Engine    | Large       | 3      |         |
| Radar     | Short Range | 1      |         |
| Missile   | Javelin     | 2      |         |
| Total     |             | 8      |         |
</details>

### Chase like a dog - RoboDog 

This robot uses the `scan()` method to find enemies and chases them. 
![RoboDog](images/roboDog.jpg)

<details>
<summary>RoboDog Details</summary>

RoboDog moves at random and scans what is right in front of it. When this dog bites, it won't let go!

This robot uses the `scan()` method to find targets right in from of it. If it does it adjust it's heading to move towards the target, this dog can hit you with a missile and with collision damage!

| Equipment | Type              | Points | Details |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------ | ------- |
| Armor     | Light             | 2      |         |
| Engine    | Standard          | 3      |         |
| Radar     | Ultra Short Range | 0      |         |
| Missile   | Cannon            | 3      |         |
| Total     |                   | 8      |         |
</details>

### TargetRobot 

This robot just sits down and waits to be hit. 
![TargetRobot](images/targetRobot.png)

<details>
<summary>TargetRobot Details</summary>

Please don't be the target robot, and nobody wants to be the target robot!

| Equipment | Type              | Points | Details |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------ | ------- |
| Armor     | Heavy             | 3      |         |
| Engine    | Economy           | 0      |         |
| Radar     | Ultra Short Range | 0      |         |
| Missile   | Dart              | 0      |         |
| Total     |                   | 3      |         |
</details>


### Remember that 
- Other robots may be out of radar range, requiring your robot to move periodically. 
- Your robot can be damaged by its own missiles. 
- Check `gameInfo.farHitRange` to make sure your target is beyond the damage range. 
- If you don't mind a bit of self-inflicted pain, you can also use `gameInfo.nearHitRange` or even `game.directHitRange` instead.
</details>

## Level 3: Create an Evasion Strategy


<details>
<summary>Develop your evasion strategy</summary>
 
Add the `YosemiteSam` ARN twice to the KT-Robots server to create two attackers.

Now update the behavior of `BringYourOwnRobot` to avoid getting shot. 

<details>
<summary>Examples</summary>

You can be in continuous motion, like `YosemiteSam`, which zig-zags across the board, react to damage like `HotShot`,  or chase and ram into your opponents like `RoboDog`.

Beware that a robot cannot change heading without suddenly stopping if its speed exceeds `Robot.MaxSpeed`.
</details>
</details>

## Level 4: Take on the Champ

<details>
<summary>Test if your robot is good enough</summary>

Add the `HotShot` ARN once to the KT-Robots server to create one formidable opponent.

Consider modifying your robot build by tuning the 
- engine
- armor 
- missile
- radar 

Set the proper equipment to suit your attack and evasion strategies. 

**Remember that your build cannot exceed 8 points or your robot will be disqualified from the competition.**

</details>


## BOSS LEVEL: Enter the Multi-Team Deathmatch Competition

<details>
<summary>Test if your robot is the best</summary>

![killer-robots](images/killerRobots.jpg)


For the boss level, your opponent is every other team! Submit your robot ARN and see how well it fares.

**May the odds be ever in your favor!**

<summary>Reference Details</summary>

### Pre-Build Lambda-Robots

The `lambda-robots/src/main/kotlin/io.onema.ktrobots.lambda/functions/` folder contains additional robots that are deployed, these have different behaviors.
Next, we need a few robots to battle it out. 
* `TargetRobot`: This is a stationary robot for other robots to practice on.
* `YosemiteSam`: This robot runs around shooting in random directions as fast as it can.
* `HotShot`: This robot uses its radar to find other robots and fire at them. When hit, this robot moves around the board.
* `RoboDog`: This robot moves around shooting straight in front of it, when it finds a target it changes direction and chasses it, this robot will do collision damage.

### LambdaRobots SDK

Derive your Lambda-Robot from the `LambdaRobotFunction` provided by the SDK.

#### Abstract Methods
The base class requires two methods to be implemented:

| Method                                                                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fun getBuild(state: LambdaRobotState): Pair<LambdaRobotBuild, LambdaRobotState>`   | This method returns the robot build information, including its name, armor, engine, missile, and radar types, and the robot state object. Note that a build cannot exceed 8 points by default, or the robot will be disqualified at the beginning of the match.
| `fun getAction(state: LambdaRobotState): Pair<LambdaRobotAction, LambdaRobotState>` | This method returns the actions taken by the robot during the turn and the updated robot state                                                                                                                                                                 |

#### Missile

![missile](images/missiles.png)

When shooting a missile a heading and a range must be set. Depending on the missile, the range cannot exceed the Max. Range.
Each missile causes damage only when it reaches its set range, none otherwise. When a missile explodes it can cause up to three types of damage:

| **Shooting**                    | **Direct hit damage**                             | **Near hit damage**                            | **Far hit damage**                           |
