# Programming Reference

## Pre-Build Lambda-Robots

The `lambda-robots/src/main/kotlin/io.onema.ktrobots.lambda/functions/` folder contains additional robots that are deployed, these have different behaviors.
Next, we need a few robots to battle it out.
* `TargetRobot`: This is a stationary robot for other robots to practice on.
* `YosemiteSam`: This robot runs around shooting in random directions as fast as it can.
* `HotShot`: This robot uses its radar to find other robots and fire at them. When hit, this robot moves around the board.
* `RoboDog`: This robot moves around shooting straight in front of it, when it finds a target it changes direction and chasses it, this robot will do collision damage.

## LambdaRobots SDK

Derive your Lambda-Robot from the `LambdaRobotFunction` provided by the SDK.

### Abstract Methods
The base class requires two methods to be implemented:

| Method                                                                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fun getBuild(state: LambdaRobotState): Pair<LambdaRobotBuild, LambdaRobotState>`   | This method returns the robot build information, including its name, armor, engine, missile, and radar types, and the robot state object. Note that a build cannot exceed 8 points by default, or the robot will be disqualified at the beginning of the match.
| `fun getAction(state: LambdaRobotState): Pair<LambdaRobotAction, LambdaRobotState>` | This method returns the actions taken by the robot during the turn and the updated robot state                                                                                                                                                                 |

### Missile

![missile](../images/missiles.png)

When shooting a missile a heading and a range must be set. Depending on the missile, the range cannot exceed the Max. Range.
Each missile causes damage only when it reaches its set range, none otherwise. When a missile explodes it can cause up to three types of damage:

| **Shooting**                    | **Direct hit damage**                             | **Near hit damage**                            | **Far hit damage**                           |
